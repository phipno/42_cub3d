Might need a int type vector
struct t_vec_int
{
	int x;
	int y;
}

and functions to calculate with them like (add, substract, distance betw them)

vec_int_new(int x, int y);
vec_int_add(t_vec_int a; t_vec_int b);
vec_int_subtract;
vec_int_distance;

maybe a struct that contains two vectors which would make a line?

geometry trigometry  basics (math) (delta, alpha and so on --> english terms)

sin
cos
tan

first task:
ground and sky color 
minimap to get used with it 

Minimap:
Loop through a certain amount of pixels (size of minimap)
Loop through array
	For every thing in array put size amount of pixels 
scale with width and height
Free function for minimap
